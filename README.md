# concurrent_http_proxy
A self conceived concurrent http proxy server


To test the proxy server on your local machine simply set your browser (i.e firefox) settings to:

Preferences -> Network Settings -> Manual proxy configuration: HTTP Proxy 127.0.0.1 Port 9877

And then simply start the server from your terminal:
```shell
./http_proxy
```
